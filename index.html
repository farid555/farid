  <h4> HOBBIES
  </h4>
<div>
  <p class ="para2">My favorite hobby is now doing website designing. 
    I enjoy making a new website and learn about new 
    staff regarding <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code> coding. when I am free. 
    I started doing my web designing this summer when my 
    school was closed. I had a penalty of time to play 
    with Html coding and discover the website design and 
    I did it, I felt interested. So I kept doing this staff.
     I was happy to learn the coding. I enjoy coding because 
     I can create my website. I have quite a good experience 
     with a <code>Markup language</code>. Now I tried to learn HTML, CSS, 
     and afterward, I will start learning <code>JavaScript</code>. So this 
     my plan. On the other hand, I like to do photography. 
     I have quite good skills in photography. I am good at 
     graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop,Adobe 
     Illustrator, etc. My subject is nature, people, cities, 
     and the sky.
